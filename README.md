# Basic C++: Overloading

Overloading is a feature of C++ that allows you to have multiple functions or constructors with the same name.
This helps organize code so that functions that behave similarly, but with varying parameters can be easily identified.

# Setup

You will need to have CMake installed on your computer, and properly added to your path.
In order to setup, run the following in a shell, then open the project in your preferred editor.
Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.

Windows:
```
cd path/to/folder
setup.cmd
```
Linux:
```
cd path/to/folder
./setup
```
